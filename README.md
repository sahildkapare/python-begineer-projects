Collection of begineer Python projects

◇Welcome to my repository of beginner Python projects! This collection is a showcase of my journey in learning and applying Python fundamentals. Each project is designed to help me practice core concepts, and I'll be adding more as I continue to grow my skills.

1~ 🎲 Number Guessing Game

A simple Python CLI game where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 10, and the player has to guess it. The game provides hints ("too high"/"too low") until the correct number is guessed, a play again option is also provided.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer
2. Save the code as `numbguess_game.py`
3. Open terminal/command prompt and navigate to the file location
4. Run the program:

Sample Run (Screenshot + Text Example)

## 🖥️ Sample Run
Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 10.
Enter your guess: 7
Too low! Try again.
Enter your guess: 10
Too high! Try again.
Enter your guess: 9
🎉 Congratulations! You guessed the number 9 in 3 attempts.

Would you like to play again? (y/n): No
